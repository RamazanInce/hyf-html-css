  <div id="container">

    <p id="firstp"> <br>In this Web site, you will read some articles why we, teachers, are failing in teaching Mathematics and try to emphasize that Mathematics is the easiest subject among the others. As a starting point, I would like to present four articles.</p>

    <ul id="title">
      <li>
        <h3><a href="#title-of-the">Title of the topic or content, which one should come first?</a></h3>

    </p>
    <h2 id="title-of-the"><em style="font-size: 150%;"><br><br>Title</em> of the topic or <em style="font-size: 150%;">content</em> which one should come first? </h2>
    <p>As an instructor, we should always keep in our mind that Mathematics is the most unknown subject among the learners. There is a belief in human subconscious that every individual is tend to be afraid from the things, which are unknown to him/her.
      <p>This is the main reason why many students stay away from math. <img class="images" src="http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/media/eps/schoolofmathematics/board.jpg" alt="A Mathematics teacher does a calculation on the blackboard"><span class="important-sentence">If we can find a way that shows the students mathematics is not something unknown, everything in it is known by them.</span>        However not only the students but also many of the Math teachers also are unaware of this fact. </p>
      <p>Our article is not only targeting the students but also teachers. Let us look at the following sample from real life itself.
      </p>
      <p id="ice-skate-sample">Just imagine a student who knows how to ride a skate and has not experience ice-skate yet. He/she comes to you and ask for assistance from you. As you are good at ice-skating but had many bad experiences in your past. The time when you experienced
        it first, you had broken your leg and had a cut in your fingers. Now your duty is to teach how to use ice-skate to that student. </p>
      <p>You may talk about your past experience and try to let him know how difficult to learn and how dangerous it to that kid.<br> Or
        <br> You may tell him/her that since he/she already knows using skates then it will be so simple and learn ice skate.<br> You may apply both ways to your students and observe the outcome.<br> In my case, I observed a successful result with the
        second way however as for the first case, the learning was not easily processed.</p>

      <p>As a teacher, we should make the things as simple as possible. <span class="important-sentence">I believe that what we are going to teach them is already known by them, but we are not aware of it.</span>
      </p>
      <h4><a href="#firstp">Move Up</a></h4>

      <h2><a id="definitions-are-in">Definitions are in or out?</a></h2>
      <p> I believe many of us watched the Indian movie called "Three Idiots", which pictures out the wrong side of the education system in India. <span class="important-sentence">Do you think that this problem is only concerning India or all of us?</span><br>I
        think many of the math teachers have that problem in a different way, not exactly the same way which is shown in the movie. In one scene, there was a lesson going on and a professor ask for the<strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MlkASchodc">definition of a machine.</a></strong>        In that part of the movie it really explains what a definition means. <img class="images" src="https://www.mathsone.com/uploads/blog/1524477238maths-One-Blog-image.jpg" alt="there is black board with the written mathematical definition on it">
        <span class="important-sentence">Definition is what you understood not how you described it.</span></p>
      <p>For example, to solve a question in fractions, you do not need to know or define what a denominator or numerator means. If you could understand, that 7/9 means: cutting something into 9 pieces, which are the same in size and you are mentioning 7
        of them. At this point, to know the definition of numerator or denominator is not the essential part. You can name it with whatever you wish, i.e. up-down or above-bottom or this-that.
      </p>
      <p><span class="important-sentence">The key point here should be to understand what 7/9 represents.</span></p>
      <p>Let’s give an another example. Improper or proper fraction tells students that "an improper fraction is a fraction in which the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator" and "a proper fraction is a fraction in which the denominator
        is greater than the numerator". Instead of giving that definition, there is a simple way to explain. You may just cut an apple into four pieces and give to students each portion and ask him "Which part of the apple do you have?" Then simply he
        could answer you that<img class="images appleimage" src="http://www.coreknowledge.org.uk/images/imagelibrary/y2maths_fractions2.jpg" alt="contains a whole apple, a three quarter apple, half apple and a quarter apple" width="200">
        <ul>
          <li> <strong class="apple-fraction"> one out of four</strong></li>
          <li> <strong class="apple-fraction"> two out of four</strong></li>
          <li> <strong class="apple-fraction">three out of four</strong></li>
          <li> <strong class="apple-fraction">four out of four.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After all these steps, just take out a quarter piece of an apple from your drawer and ask the same question again "Which part of the apple do you have?" <br> That is your<strong class="apple-fraction"> "aha"</strong> point, the student may answer
          your question without thinking that
          <strong class="apple-fraction">it is not possible to have 5 pieces out of 4.</strong> At this point, all of us captured the picture. <span class="important-sentence">That is why we cannot name 5 out of 4 as a fraction.</span> Then ask your students
          to give fractions like 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4 and 5/4, 6/4.</p>

        <h2><a id="what-is-the">Mathematics Shorten Everything Possible. Mentioning the Name of the New Topic is a Proper Start.</a></h2>
        <p>As a teacher, I always stay away from formulas and definitions. Even for the new topics, I do not mention the name of the topic. Many students are afraid of unknown titles.</p>

        <p>For exam when I am teaching exponents, I started the class with examples like followings.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">

          4 + 4 + 4+ 4+ 4+ 4 = ?<br> 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = ?</p>

        <p>
          They can easily answer questions like that. I asked similar ones. After some practice, I asked them to write an equivalent expression, asking them please re-write the expression in a shorter way.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
          4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 4x5<br> 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 3x5</p>

        <p>

          <span class="important-sentence">Then after addition, they found out that multiplication is the short way of addition in other way multiplication is repeated addition.</span></p>

        <p>

          Next example will be</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">

          2x2x2x2x2 = ? <br>3x3x3x3 = ?</p>

        <p>

          I asked many similar questions for them to find the answer.</p>

        <p>

          I want them to write it in a shorter way. I observe that they find original answers. <img src="https://media.licdn.com/media/gcrc/dms/image/C4E12AQFK5ChJzAsjAQ/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0?e=1550102400&v=beta&t=W1Rn9CtZIaFg7LR1CaeukbCnmL0Ybgx_C-PW4mzzKOM"
            class="images" alt=" A lego man is infornt of a mathematics blak board">At least, some of them find the correct way of writing. We need to name it like repeated edition means multiplication with same logic repeated multiplication is exponent.
          Then we can start to talk about exponents.</p>

        <p>

          That is how I started to teach exponents.</p>

        <p>

          <span class="important-sentence">Everybody afraid of mathematics they have fear in somewhere else in their heart</span>. Teacher’s main duty is to assist his/her students the kill that fear. Math should not be their nightmare. It should not
          be something, which they believe they cannot get ever and never.</p>

        <p>

          What I observe up to now if they believe they are the ones putting the rules on the ground they will co-operate and try more.</p>

        <p>

          I always try to teach in that way in each topic even for grade 12 students during the teaching of integral. I do not write the title as integral.</p>

        <p>

          I asked a simple derivative question then asked them undo operation. After doing some practice we try to name the operation. Some time we name the integration as James operation one of the students name in our class.</p>

        <p>

          Later on for the others to understand what we are talking about, let us use the name, which all mathematicians used.</p>

        <p>

          After learning the concept of the topic, naming is coming. When you start with the name as integration some of the students will blocked them self but already they know it since they know the derivative. <span class="important-sentence">With this type of approach you can broke their
        fear walls.</span>

        <!-- This article was puplished in a newspaper in Nigeria in 2014 and taken it from https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-can-i-score-high-jamb-utm-examination-ramazan-ince/-->
        <h2><a id="how-should-we">Why can I not Score High in JAMB-UTM Examination?</a></h2>
        <p>Let us briefly introduce ourselves, we are more than one in number, before starting the following article, which we believe it will assist the candidates a lot. Actually, we are tutors with an experience of 15 years of teaching. Moreover, for
          the last 10 years, we guide many students for the placement to the higher intuitions within and outside Nigeria. In this column every week, we will try to look for an answer for a question.</p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://media.licdn.com/media/gcrc/dms/image/C4E12AQFAk305N4D1Mw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/0?e=1550102400&v=beta&t=2LRht51Cg-mr_C1_ouyp1gKzwKTLTwOhc-hjvkK1ayk" alt="An exam hall where students are wrting the JAMB exam" class="images">          As everybody knows Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is the official body that conducts an exam for the students to gain an admission into higher intuitions, which is called as Unified Tertiary Matriculation Exam (UTME).</p>
        <p>

          At this junction, we look into the highest score in UTME-JAMB. What we know is that the exam is over 400 and there is no negative marking. <span class="important-sentence">Unfortunately, when we search in google, we find out that only a few candidates scored more than 300 hundred.</span></p>
        <p>The Registrar of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. ’Dibu Ojerinde, on Friday, said only three candidates out of the 1.5 million who sat for the 2012 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations scored 300 marks and above.</p>
        <p>Ojerinde said this while announcing the release of the results of the examination that took place last Saturday.</p>
        <p>

          He explained that other categories of scores showed that 336,330 candidates scored between 1-169 marks, 374,920 scored between 170-199 marks, while 601,151 scored between 200-249 marks.</p>
        <p>

          Others were 71,339 candidates, who scored between 250 and 269. Overall, 72,243 scored more than 250 (From 2012 UTME-JAMB presses release.)</p>
        <p>Only 10 candidates out of the 1,644,110 that sat for the 2013 United Tertiary Matriculation Examination of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board scored over 300 marks.</p>
        <p>The total available score is 400.</p>
        <p>Despite this, the Registrar of JAMB, Prof. Dibu Ojerinde, said the 2013 results were better than those of the previous year. (From 2013 UTME-JAMB press release)</p>
        <p>The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board, JAMB, Thursday, said only 47 candidates scored 250 and above in the Paper Pencil Test (PPT) and Dual Based Test (DBT) modes of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) conducted across
          the country last Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Registrar/Chief Executive of JAMB, Prof. Dibu Ojerinde, stated this in Abuja, while announcing the release of the 2014 UTME results.</p>
        <p><span class="important-sentence">He said only 24 candidates scored 250 and above in the PPT while 23 candidates scored 250 and above in the DBT.</span> (From 2014 UTME-JAMB press release)</p>
        <p>From last year’s UTME scores we can easily see that it is not easy to score more than 300 hundred in the exam. As an educationist, we should trace out the reason for that and we should look into the issues to score more. Our best students have
          around 75% success in the exam, which did not show the level of our students truly. We are sure that we have perfect students but when we look at the scores, there is no any perfect score. In this column, we try find out the reasons and solutions
          of that.
        </p>
        <p>First reason and solutions<br>
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr style="background-color: #00FFFF;">
              <td>English Language</td>
              <td>Other 3 subjects</td>
              <td>Total</td>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody style="background-color: rgb(173, 216, 230);">
            <tr>
              <td>100 Questions</td>
              <td>50 Questions Each</td>
              <td>250 Questions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>75 Minutes</td>
              <td>45 Minutes for Each subject</td>
              <td>210 Questions</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>45 Seconds Per Questions</td>
              <td>54 Seconds Per Questions</td>
              <td>50 Seconds Per Questions</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>In addition, our students generally are not able to finish the exam on time, which is the main reason of getting low scores. Because of the timing, you could not attempt some of the questions in some papers <strong>whether the questions are easy or
              difficult.</strong> Whenever you did not attempt a question, it is clear that you failed in that question.</p>
        <p><span class="important-sentence">When one studies a topic, one of the most important issues is understanding and then getting the right answer in a limited time.</span> Thus,</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>it is needed to practice more even if the topic is understood very well.</li>
            <li>However, keeping time is dreadfully essential to get all the questions attempted and increase the correct number of the questions solved.</li>
            <li> To look for any shortcut in calculations where needed can also save us more time.</li>
            <li>To practice more multiple-choice questions on a studied topic will be beneficial for UTM Exam rather than answering in a theory (essay) type in regard of their logical differences</li>
            <li> Not spend much time on the difficult questions during the exam.</li>
            <li>in each subject we have to concentrate on the easier topics then the harder ones.</li>
